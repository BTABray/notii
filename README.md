# Notii Mod for FNF
Alright, so first things first. This is just an alternate download link, since GameBanana's servers download at not quite the fastest speed, and I don't want people downloading this and waiting forever, so just to clear that up, this is ONLY AN ALTERNATE DOWNLOAD LINK.
## GameBanana Description
Whoops! You were just listening to music with your girlfriend, but you get sucked in, and meet a musical note. She was just just dancing, and you interrupted the best part of the song. Now, of course, you couldn't keep your mouth shut, and said "beep blip bap beep" which means, "rap battle me now". So, she's trying to make this quick, because she wants to return to her wonderful dancing. She says her names is Notii, and decide to start rapping.
